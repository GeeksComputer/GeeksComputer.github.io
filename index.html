                    <h2>Welcome to My Blog</h2>
                    <p><em>This is My Blog for free learn The Network Security Programming.</em></p>
                    <p>Welcome visitors to my blog to learn network security programming, on this blog you want to
learn network security by programming, but before that you have to learn about networks and
make network simulations so that you can easily understand how networks work, here I have
suggestions for making simulations network, namely by using software such as Cisco Packet
Tracer, GNS3, and others. Apart from that, you also have to learn about related programming
languages such as C/C++, Python, etc. as well as scripting such as Bash, Batch, etc.</p>
                    <p>Below I provide source code for conducting simple network security and defense tests written in
the programming language C/C++, Python, Bash scripting. Make sure you use it wisely without
breaking the law and responsibly. Please visit the github link with click button in below.</p>
                    <a class="more" href="#">Visit Github</a>
